# Confluence-Age "Old Confluence"
This extension overlays a progressively less transparent "parchment" over Confluence pages, based on how old they are. 

## Features

- Overlay a "parchment" canvas that covers the entire body of a Confluence page.
- The brownness of the parchment increases progressively the older the page is.  Anything less than a month old does not show the parchment at all.
- The parchment uses an SVG filter for a stylized look and is also given a parchment CSS class.
- The "brownness" of the parchment are displayed on the top-right corner of the canvas.
